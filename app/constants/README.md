# Constants

This directory contains application-wide constants and configuration values used throughout the codebase.

## Purpose

The constants directory is used for:
- Defining application-wide constants
- Centralizing configuration values
- Providing named values for magic numbers and strings
- Ensuring consistency across the application

## Organization

Constants should be organized by domain or functionality:
- `app_constants.go`: General application constants
- `error_constants.go`: Error codes and messages
- `http_constants.go`: HTTP-related constants
- `validation_constants.go`: Validation-related constants

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive constant names that clearly indicate their purpose
- Group related constants together
- Use appropriate types for constants (string, int, etc.)
- Document constants with clear descriptions
- Avoid duplicating constants across different files
- Consider using enums (iota) for sequential constants
- Use constants instead of magic numbers or strings in code
- Keep constants immutable and use them for values that should not change
