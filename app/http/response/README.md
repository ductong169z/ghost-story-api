# Response

This directory contains response structures and formatters for HTTP responses.

## Purpose

The response directory is responsible for:
- Defining standardized response formats
- Providing helper functions for creating responses
- Ensuring consistent response structure across the application
- Handling different response types (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.)
- Managing response status codes and headers

## Structure

- **system_info_response.go**: Response structure for system information

## Usage

Response structures are used in controllers to format and send HTTP responses:

```
// Example pseudocode for using response structures
// Note: This is not actual implementation code

// In a controller:
func GetSystemInfoHandler(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {
    info := getSystemInfo()

    // Create a response using the defined structure
    response := response.NewSystemInfoResponse(info)

    // Send the response
    response.Send(ctx)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use consistent response formats across the application
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include pagination metadata for list responses
- Document response structures
- Handle different content types appropriately
- Consider versioning for API responses
- Include request IDs for debugging
- Use proper content type headers
