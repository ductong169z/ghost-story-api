# Routes

This directory contains route definitions for the application, organizing endpoints and connecting them to their respective controllers.

## Purpose

The routes directory is responsible for:
- Defining all application endpoints
- Grouping related routes together
- Applying middleware to routes
- Connecting routes to controller handlers
- Organizing routes by type (API, web, etc.)

## Structure

- **routes.go**: Main route configuration and setup
- **api_routes.go**: Routes for API endpoints
- **web_routes.go**: Routes for web pages

## Usage

Routes are defined using the router provided by the framework:

```
// Example pseudocode for defining routes
// Note: This is not actual implementation code

// In api_routes.go:
func RegisterAPIRoutes(router *Router) {
    // Group routes with common prefix
    apiGroup := router.Group("/api/v1")

    // Apply middleware to all routes in this group
    apiGroup.Use(middleware.Auth())

    // Define routes
    apiGroup.GET("/users", controllers.ListUsers)
    apiGroup.POST("/users", controllers.CreateUser)
    apiGroup.GET("/users/:id", controllers.GetUser)
    apiGroup.PUT("/users/:id", controllers.UpdateUser)
    apiGroup.DELETE("/users/:id", controllers.DeleteUser)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Group related routes together
- Use descriptive route names that reflect their purpose
- Apply appropriate middleware for authentication, logging, etc.
- Keep route definitions clean and organized
- Use versioning for API routes
- Document routes with comments
- Consider using route parameters for resource identification
- Separate API routes from web routes
- Use consistent naming conventions for endpoints
