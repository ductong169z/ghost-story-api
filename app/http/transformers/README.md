# Transformers

This directory contains data transformers used to convert internal data structures into standardized API responses.

## Purpose

Transformers are responsible for:
- Converting domain models into API response formats
- Standardizing the structure of API responses
- Hiding internal implementation details from API consumers
- Providing consistent data formatting across the API

## Usage

Transformers are typically used in controllers to format data before sending it as a response:

```
// Example pseudocode of using a transformer in a controller
// Note: This is not actual implementation code

// In a controller file:
func GetUserHandler(ctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {
    user, err := userRepository.FindById(userId)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
        return
    }

    // Transform the user model into an API response
    response := transformers.TransformUser(user)

    // Send the response
    response.Send(ctx)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep transformers simple and focused on data conversion
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `Transform<ModelName>`)
- Include all necessary fields in the transformed data
- Handle nested relationships appropriately
- Consider versioning for API compatibility
- Document the transformation logic
- Write tests for transformers to ensure correct data conversion
