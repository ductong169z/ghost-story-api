# HTTP Layer

This directory contains all components related to handling HTTP requests and responses in the application.

## Structure

- **controllers/**: Contains controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests
  - **api/**: API controllers for RESTful endpoints
  - **page/**: Page controllers for web pages
- **middleware/**: HTTP middleware for request/response processing
- **request/**: Request validation and processing
- **response/**: Response formatting and standardization
- **routes/**: Route definitions and grouping
- **transformers/**: Data transformers for API responses

## Purpose

The HTTP layer is responsible for:
- Handling incoming HTTP requests
- Validating request data
- Processing requests through appropriate middleware
- Routing requests to the correct controllers
- Transforming and returning appropriate responses

## Best Practices

- Keep controllers thin, delegating business logic to services
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Validate all incoming requests
- Use transformers to standardize API responses
- Group related routes together
