# Error Handling

This directory contains custom error types, error handling middleware, and error utilities for the application.

## Purpose

The errors directory is used for:
- Defining custom error types specific to the application
- Implementing error handling middleware
- Providing utilities for consistent error responses
- Centralizing error codes and messages

## Usage

- Custom error types should implement the standard Go error interface
- Error handling middleware can be used to catch and process errors in HTTP requests
- Error utilities can help format error responses consistently
- Error codes and messages should be defined as constants for consistency

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive error types that indicate what went wrong
- Include relevant context in error messages
- Implement proper error wrapping for maintaining error chains
- Log errors appropriately based on severity
- Return user-friendly error messages in API responses
- Use consistent error codes across the application
