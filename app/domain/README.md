# Domain Layer

This directory contains the core domain logic and business rules of the application.

## Structure

- **models/**: Domain models representing the core business entities
- **repository/**: Data access layer for interacting with the database

## Purpose

The domain layer is responsible for:
- Defining the core business entities and their relationships
- Implementing business rules and validation logic
- Providing a clean, domain-focused API for the application layers

## Best Practices

- Keep domain models focused on business concepts, not technical concerns
- Implement business rules and validation within the domain layer
- Use repositories to abstract data access from domain logic
- Avoid dependencies on external frameworks or libraries in domain models
- Ensure domain models are properly encapsulated with appropriate getters and setters
- Use value objects for concepts that are defined by their attributes rather than an identity
