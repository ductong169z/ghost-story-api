# Utilities

This directory contains utility functions and helper classes that provide common functionality used throughout the application.

## Purpose

The utils directory is used for:
- Providing reusable helper functions
- Implementing common algorithms and operations
- Wrapping external libraries with application-specific interfaces
- Offering utility classes for common tasks

## Usage

Utilities should be:
- Stateless and pure functions when possible
- Well-documented with clear examples
- Thoroughly tested
- Focused on a specific type of functionality

## Organization

Consider organizing utilities by category:
- `string_utils.go`: String manipulation functions
- `time_utils.go`: Date and time handling functions
- `file_utils.go`: File operations
- `crypto_utils.go`: Cryptographic operations
- `http_utils.go`: HTTP-related utilities

## Best Practices

- Keep utility functions simple and focused on a single task
- Use descriptive function names that clearly indicate what the function does
- Document parameters, return values, and any side effects
- Write comprehensive tests for utility functions
- Avoid dependencies on application-specific code in utilities
- Consider performance implications for frequently used utilities
