# Services

This directory contains service classes that implement business logic and orchestrate interactions between different parts of the application.

## Purpose

Services are responsible for:
- Implementing business logic that doesn't belong in controllers or models
- Orchestrating interactions between multiple repositories or external APIs
- Providing reusable functionality across different parts of the application
- Encapsulating complex operations into cohesive units

## Usage

Services should:
- Be focused on a specific domain or functionality
- Have clear, well-defined interfaces
- Be stateless when possible
- Be testable in isolation

## Best Practices

- Keep services focused on a single responsibility
- Use dependency injection to provide dependencies to services
- Avoid direct database access in services; use repositories instead
- Document service methods with clear descriptions of parameters and return values
- Write unit tests for service methods
- Use interfaces to define service contracts when appropriate
- Consider organizing services by domain or feature
