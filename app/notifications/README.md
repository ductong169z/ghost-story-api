# Notifications

This directory contains notification classes and templates used for sending various types of notifications to users.

## Purpose

The notifications directory is used for:
- Defining notification types (email, SMS, push notifications, etc.)
- Creating templates for notification content
- Implementing notification delivery logic
- Managing notification preferences and settings

## Structure

- Each notification type should be defined in its own file
- Notification templates may be stored in subdirectories by type
- Common notification utilities can be shared in helper files

## Usage

Notifications can be sent using the notification service. For example:

```
// Example of sending a notification
resetPassword := notifications.ResetPassword{
    Email: "user@example.com",
}

if err := notification.Send(resetPassword); err != nil {
    log.Error(err)
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep notification content separate from delivery logic
- Use templates for notification content to maintain consistency
- Support multiple notification channels when appropriate
- Allow users to manage notification preferences
- Include proper error handling for notification delivery failures
- Test notification rendering and delivery
- Consider internationalization for notifications
