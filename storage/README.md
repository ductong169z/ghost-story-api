# Storage

This directory contains files that are generated or uploaded during the application's runtime.

## Purpose

The storage directory is used for:
- User-uploaded files
- Application-generated files
- Log files
- Temporary files
- Cache files
- Session data

## Structure

- **app/**: Application-specific storage for uploaded files and generated content
- **logs/**: Application log files
- **tmp/**: Temporary files that can be safely deleted

## Usage

The storage directory should:
- Be writable by the application
- Have appropriate permissions set
- Be backed up regularly (especially the app/ subdirectory)
- Be excluded from version control (except for the directory structure)

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate subdirectories to organize files
- Implement proper file cleanup routines for temporary files
- Set up log rotation for log files
- Validate and sanitize all uploaded files
- Use secure file naming conventions
- Consider using cloud storage for production environments
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive files
